NetBox is an open-source web application designed to help manage and document computer networks. Initially developed by the network engineering team at DigitalOcean, NetBox was specifically designed to address the needs of network and infrastructure engineers for a comprehensive network documentation system.

Here's a high-level overview of how you can install and configure NetBox on Ubuntu. This guide assumes you are using Ubuntu 20.04, but similar steps can be applied to other versions of Ubuntu with minor adjustments.

**Step 1: Update Your System**

Before installing any new software, it's a good practice to update your system's package index.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**

NetBox has several dependencies, including PostgreSQL, Redis, and Python. Install them with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev libpq-dev build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
sudo apt install -y postgresql libpq-dev
sudo apt install -y redis-server
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

**Step 3: Create PostgreSQL Database and User**

You'll need to create a database and user for NetBox within PostgreSQL.

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Once in the PostgreSQL console, run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE netbox;
CREATE USER netbox WITH PASSWORD 'password123';
ALTER ROLE netbox SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE netbox SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE netbox SET timezone TO 'UTC';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE netbox TO netbox;
\q
```

Replace 'netbox_user_password' with a secure password of your choice.

**Step 4: Download NetBox**

At the time of writing, you should download the latest stable release of NetBox from its GitHub repository. You can find the latest release version on the NetBox GitHub releases page.

```bash
cd /opt
sudo git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox.git
cd netbox
```

**Step 5: Install Python Dependencies**

Setup a Python virtual environment and install the necessary Python packages with pip.

```bash
python3 -m venv /opt/netbox/venv
source /opt/netbox/venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 6: Configure NetBox**

Copy and edit the configuration file to reflect your setup.

```bash
cp /opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.example.py /opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py
nano /opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py
```

Make sure to set `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, `DATABASE`, `REDIS`, and other settings according to your environment.

**Step 7: Run Database Migrations**

You'll need to run database migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
cd /opt/netbox/netbox
./manage.py migrate
```

**Step 8: Create a Superuser**

Create an administrative user for NetBox:

```bash
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Step 9: Collect Static Files**

Collect static files for the NetBox web interface:

```bash
./manage.py collectstatic --no-input
```

**Step 10: Configure gunicorn**

Install gunicorn (a Python WSGI HTTP server for UNIX) to serve NetBox.

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

Create a gunicorn configuration script:

```bash
nano /opt/netbox/gunicorn_config.py
```

And add the following configuration:

```python
command = '/opt/netbox/venv/bin/gunicorn'
pythonpath = '/opt/netbox/netbox'
bind = '0.0.0.0:8001'
workers = 3
user = 'www-data'
```

**Step 11: Test Gunicorn's Ability to Serve NetBox**

Run the following command to test if Gunicorn can serve NetBox:

```bash
gunicorn -c /opt/netbox/gunicorn_config.py netbox.wsgi
```

If everything is configured properly, you should be able to access NetBox through your web browser at `http://your_server_ip:8001`.


**Step 12: Configure a web server**
to serve Netbox. Create a new file /etc/nginx/sites-available/netbox with the following content:  
```bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_or_ip;

    location /static/ {
        alias /opt/netbox/netbox/static/;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:8001;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```
Enable the Nginx configuration and restart Nginx:  

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/netbox /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

**Step 12: Configure Systemd**

Configure systemd to manage the NetBox processes. Create a systemd service file for Gunicorn:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/netbox.service
```

And add the following:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=NetBox WSGI Service
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=www-data
Group=www-data
